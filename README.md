## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- ffmpeg

## Installation

## Command-line usage

The `transcribe` subcommand allows you to transcribe a video file into a SubRip Subtitle (SRT) file. 
It also has the option to automatically add the generated subtitles to the video.

The `subtitle` subcommand allows you to add subtitles to a video using an already existing SRT file. 
This subcommand does not perform transcription, but rather assumes that the SRT file has already been created. 
It is typically used by people who want to validate the accuracy of a transcription generated by the transcribe subcommand.
